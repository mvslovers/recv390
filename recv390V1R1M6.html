</pre><p>  
This is modifcation 6 of <B>RECV390</B>. RECV390 is a commandline tool for extracting on mainframe transmitted files on a PC.
TSO <B>TRANSMIT</B> or short XMIT is a technique used on mainframe to pack a file or members of a PDS file into a
sequential file in order to ease transportation between mainframes. Mainframe <B>PDS</B> can be considered in some way as
a single directory, with PDS-members as files within. As other file types like VSAM and sequential files are possible to
XMIT, the main application of TSO TRANSMIT is today the unloading of PDS for a later restore (TSO RECEIVE). The
counterpart of the TSO TRANSMIT is therefore TSO <B>RECEIVE</B> to recreate the  original file. The process is comparable
to TAR in UNIX environments. Like native TAR, there is no builtin compression. RECV390 enables to RECEIVE such mainframe
xmitted files on a PC, and hence to view and extract the contents of this files without the need to access a mainframe.
</pre><p>  
There are some other tools for this purpose in place like XMIT-manager. For a comprehensive overview see
 
 <a href="http://www.planetmvs.com/unxmit/index.html">UnXMIT information exchange from David Alcock</a>.
 
When I searched for a commandline program for receiving such files on PC, I found RECV390. The program is completely
controlled via arguments and therefore usable for scripting purposes. Another issue is the availablity of the source,
which makes it possible, to add lacking functionality (and to correct some errrors), and to port and use it in LINUX
environments.
 
RECV390 was developed by James M. Morrison of Enhanced Software Services, Inc. in 2000, and was later released
with source code to public domain with Version V1R1M4.
 
The original code and its documentation is still valid in most cases. Please consider to refer the
 <a href="./recv390v1r1m4.html">original documentation</a>
for operating. The documentation below only applies to changes since this level.

</pre><p>  
My first interest was to enhance RECV390 <B>to be suitable for my needs</B>. So most changes are implemented from my special
point of view. Originally J. M. Morrsion wrote RECV390 to extract the members of a XMIT-file, created from a PDS
with
RECFM=[F|V]B
on a mainframe, containing text oriented contents, to a PC directory.
 
For this case RECV390 works well, and in fact I am convinced, this is the most important case still in practice. Only a
few of my changes relate to bugs in the original code, like <I>Bug Fix Zero-Bytes Trailer Blocks IEBCOPY</I> or Bug Fix <I>Multi-Segment Control Records</I>
which occur in a very special situations. The other changes were driven to handle special PDS contents and hence XMIT files
like <B>Embedded XMIT</B> and <B>Member Alias</B>. Another group of changes relates to the usability of the program on PC.
E.g. <B>Single Member Extract</B>.
</pre><p>  
The source of RECV390 is written in C. The style of the coding of J.M. Morrison is a little bit exotic, while mainframers
should feel some sympathy for this kind of coding C programs. I kept the code and functionality as most as possible, and
tried to implement the changes in a very smooth way. So the original documentation is still valid. I made only one exeption.
The default extension for PC files is no more .TXT but .ASC .

</pre><p>  
Some annotations to parmeter parsing in RECV390. Parameter handling differs from standard Linux or Windows . Generally
a prefix plus means in RECV390, the value is active. In contrast prefix minus inactivates a parameter. The default prefixes
for the keywords can be found with the <B>+switch</B> switch on the command prompt.

</pre><table width="100%" border="1"><tr><td><pre>   
 (1) switches ................: Original RECV390. Toggle Switches + and - .
                                Plus prefix means switch is active, while
                                minus prefix is the negation of the parameter.
 
                                Example:
                                   recv390 -dir my.pds.xmi     will NOT show directory information
                                   recv390 +dir my.pds.xmi     will show directory information
 
                                This is a little bit exotic, because standard parameter
                                handling in Linux / WIN32 would interpret first example
                                as dir parameter active, and the second example as syntax error (maybe).
 
 
 (2) keyword=value parameters : New introduced with RECV390 1.1.5.
                                Can appear in any order and mixed with positional parameters.
                                But must appear after any switch. hyphen as prefix character
                                not allowed. See above.
 
                                Example:
                                   recv390 +write my.pds.xmi xpath=/tmp/ asc
 
                                In this example, the parameter xpath= is between
                                the first positional parm my.pds, which describes the
                                xmit-dataset to extract, and the second positional parameter
                                which describes the output extension.
 
 (3) positional ..............: Original RECV390.
                                Order is significant, which is basically true for positional parameters.
                                Can be mixed with keyword=value parameters, but must appear after any
                                switch. At this time, two positional parameters are valid in RECV390.

In Modification 5 of RECV390 a new message format was introduced. It applies only to the new or changed functionalities in the
program. It is similar to the scheme known in MVS. Additionally to the message text, the identifier of the message contains
information. This approach facliitates scripting based on message identifiers. All this messages are routed to <B>stderr</B>.

</pre><p>  
While in Single Member Extract mode this message will appear nearly in all cases. The message simply tells the fact, that
there are more members in the XMIT file than extracted. In Single Member extract this is no error, because we extracting only a subset
of one member out of a PDS. I decided keeping the message in the source, because the contents of the message is true,
although a little bit confusing. If Aliases exist in the XMIT file, this message will appear too. RECV390 counts an alias
as a member.

RECV390 V1R1M4 fails to handle multi segments. In normal cases, control records don't
span more segments, so there is no pain. But in one special case control record INMR02
can be quite large. The INMR02 type record holds information about the transmitted file
and the information needed to restore. When the TRANSMIT command is invoked with the MEMBERS subparameter,
the member names are stored in a INMR02 control record. So the chance to grow above
the max length of 253 bytes with this parameter is very likely in this case. RECV390 terminates
in this situation with a message <B>unknown segment key</B>.

Inserted code to handle multi segmented records in function getseg(). This applies only
to record identifier 0x20 (control records), because for data records there is a logic already in place
(getblock() and getseg()). The inserted coding is not the best but compacted to one place without
disturbing the existing logic. Size of vars line and tranline controlled via DEFINE LINE_SIZE.

</pre><p>  
In some rare cases RECV390 original code cannot handle IEBCOPY blocks with a data length of zero bytes. In the IEBCOPY
unload format this blocks are found occasionally at the end of an member. RECV390 misses this special type of end
and joins two members errounous together. With this error the relation between directory entry and data of the members gets
out of sequence. The next directory entry points now to the next plus next member data. This is typical to the program logic of RECV390.
Described shortly, the program logic depends on the fact that directory and data are in the same order.
</pre><p>  
A reliable symptom for the destroyed sequence is message of <B>error; ISPF statistics records</B>. At this point of
extraction, all output is in error. Using the <B>-halt</B>  will not stop processing at the prompt, but will also not
solve the error situation.

</pre><p>  
The original RECV390 code extracts all Members of a transmitted PDS into the current
directory. There are no filters in place. The target directory for extraction is the current directory without
any possibilitiy to change.
</p><pre>  
</pre><H3 style="page-break-after:avoid;">Topic: Solution</H3><pre> 
</pre><p>  
This is a combined solution of the topics addressed above. I have inserted some coding to extract
a <B>single member to an optional path</B>. The single member extraction is triggered with a new
parm <B>+member</B> and an additional parm value describing the path, membername and extension.
The parm processing follows the original logic. +member means the parm is active, while
-member means no single member extraction. This is the default.

The membername is constructed from the substr starting after the last (back-)slash,
ending at the first occurence of a colon after start and with a maximum of eight chars representing a
a valid MVS membername which is not case sensitive. When no membername is given it defaults to no extension.
 
The optional path is constructed from prefix start until last slash occurence.
 
Extension (optional) is starting at the first colon after member

I've avoided to change much of the original logic until a major rewrite of the whole code.
RECV390 will read for a single member extract the whole input file regardless which
is the position of the member in the file. In the worst case, the member is on first position
and after write of the member the large rest of the file is read without any use.

RECV390 1.4 is not able to process xmitted PDS with aliases on members.
The program reads and stores the whole directory in memory and reads next
the PDS data. It expects the data in the same sequence as the directory.
Member entries and data are a kind of a linked list. First RECV390
reads the member entry from a list, and next the associated data. When an alias is picked from the list,
the logic binds the data of the next physical member in the sequence (Remember: An alias is a pointer) . But this causes an error, because the data belongs to the
next <I>non-alias</I> entry. Afterthere the sequence is destroyed.

To keep sync between member tab and data records, all alias entries will be ignored from the program logic.
When an alias is found in the member list, it will be skipped with an appropriate
message. The message names also the base member associated to.

Alias member will never be extracted. This is caused by the fact, that the existing
logic depends on one phase of reading. Extracting an alias would need a resynchronisation.
This is a todo for a later rewrite.
 
Meantime the information given in message RECV020W is sufficient to handle
necessary actions to a output member. This could be a copy command from base to alias member
or a symbolic link in UNIX.

Modified RECV390 detects embedded XMIT files at extraction time. Embedded XMITs are
transmitted PDS which are stored again as members in a PDS. So one PDS can contain multiple XMIT files.
This technique is suitable to pack multiple datasets into one XMIT.

RECV390 with modification 5 detects at extraction time. If a XMIT-header (INMR01) is present. It justs report
this fact in a message to stderr. This information can be used to process this output
further. E.g renaming the extension of the file, or to reextract this member binary, when
ASCII-translation was in place before (the parametet +binary preserves original structure of emedded
XMITs).

Native RECV390 lacks support to extract member binary. The provided switch <B>-tran</B>, which
keeps EBCDIC, inserts LF into output. But in some special cases it is necessary to
avoid any translation or preparation at extraction time. This is typical the case, when the
record format of the xmitted PDS is Undefined (RECFM=U), like Loadlibs. Another example is,
when members of a PDS itself contain a xmitted PDS. In this scenario standard extract
will produce a non usable output.
</p><pre>  
</pre><H3 style="page-break-after:avoid;">Topic: Implementation</H3><pre> 
</pre><p>  
Added new parameter <B>+binary</B>. The output will not be converted in any circumstance.
Please be aware, there is no further logical treatment of data. The output statistics
for record counter are set to zero because data is stream. Validation of counted
output records versus ISPF statistic records is therefore passed.

RECV390 until V1R1M4 extracts members from a XMIT-PDS into the current directory. Same situation appears
when +tran parameter is specified, only the current directory is searched for
a fixed named file RECV30.MAP. This makes RECV390 difficult to use in some
scripting environments. Especially when the scripting environment lacks full
shell support (like REXX or PERL in Linux and WIN32).
 
To resolve this issue, parameters are introduced to pass
the information for extraction and transaltion to RECV390 at invocation time.
</pre><p>  
Specification of a translationmap has an additional advantage, because naming
of the translationmap is free. More than one translationmap for different situations
can be stored in a central directory.
</pre><p>  
Currently the path specifications are only valid without embedded blanks. This may
change in a future release.

RECV390 was created to extract text members from a fixed blocked partitioned dataset. I have
added some functionality to the existing code to serve my purposes. If you have ideas to
add some functionality I will try to add it. Description of bugs are also welcome. Contact me with a description, or even better
add a solution and send me your changed code.
 
 
But please keep in mind that the current code base needs restructuration and rewrite as a prerequisite
to add huge functionalities. Support for DSORG=PS and support for PDSE would be nice. Also a complementary
modul XMIT390 to build XMIT-files on PC would make some sense.
